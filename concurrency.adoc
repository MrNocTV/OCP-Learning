== Thread

- A thread is a smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by the operating system.

- A process is a group of associated threads that can execute in the same, shared environment. single-thread prrocess and multi-thread process.

- A task is a single unit of work performed by a thread.

image::process_model.png[]

== Thread type

- System thread: created by JVM and runs in the background. Ex: garbage collection thread

- User defined thread: created by the developer to accomplish some task. 

- A daemon thread will not prevent the JVM from exiting when program finishes. -> A Java application terminates when the only threads that are running are daemon threads.

- Ex: If the only thread running is garbage collection thread, the JVM will automatically shutdown. Both user-defined and system threads can be marked as daemon threads.

== Understand thread concurrency

- When a thread allotted time is complete but the thread has not finished processing, a context switch occur.

- A context switch  is the process of storing a thread's current state and later restoring the state of the thread to continue execution.

- Be default, a user thread has a Thread.NORM_PROPRITY value.

- If two threads have the same priority, the thread schedular will arbitrarily choose the one to process first in most situation.

== Runable

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
----

== Creating a Thread

- There are two ways to create a Thread, 

* provide a `Runable` object or lambda expression to the `Thread` constructor.

* extends Thread class and override the `run()` method.

[source,java]
----
public class PrintData implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            System.out.println("Printing record: "+i);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        (new Thread(new PrinData())).start();
    }
}

public class ReadInventoryThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Printing zoo inventory");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        (new ReadInventoryThread()).start();
    }
}
----

- While the following code snippet will compile, none will actually execute a task on a separate processing thread.

[source,java]
----
new PrintData().run();
(new Thread(new PrintData())).run();
----

== Thread vs Runnable

- If you need to define your own Thread rules upon which multipel tasks will rely, such as priority Thread, extending Thread maybe preferable.

- Implementing `Runnable` is often a better object-oriented design practice since it separates the task being performed from the Thread object performing it.

- Implementing `Runnable` allows the class to be used by numerous Concurrency API classes.

== Polling with sleep

- Polling is the process of intermittently checking data at some fixed interval.

== Creating Thread with ExecutorService

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class ZooInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService service = null;
        try {
            service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
            System.out.println("begin");
            service.execute(() -> System.out.println("Printing zoo inventory"));
            service.execute(() -> {for(int i=0; i<3; i++)
                System.out.println("Printing record: "+i);}
            );
            service.execute(() -> System.out.println("Printing zoo inventory"));
            System.out.println("end");
        } finally {
            if(service != null) service.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
----

- With a single-thread executor, results are guaranteed to be executed in the order in which they are added to the executor service.

- Once you have finished using a thread executor, it is important that you call the `shutdown()` method. A thread executor creates a non-daemon thread on the first task that is executed, so failing to call `shutdown()` will result in your application never terminating.

- `shutdown()` will reject any new tasks submitted to the thread executor while continuinng to execute any previously sumitted tasks.

- If a new task is submitted to the thread executor while it is shutting down, a RejectedExecutionException will be thrown.

image::executor-service-life-cycle.png[]

- `List<Runnable> shutdownNow()` attempts to stop all running tasks and discards any that have not been started yet. It returns a list of tasks that were never started.

== Submitting Tasks

- `void execute(Runnable r)`
- `Future<?> submit(Runnable r)`
- `<T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)`: 
- `<T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException`: execute the given tasks, synchronously return the result of all tasks, in the same order with `Collection<? extends Callable<T>>`
- <T> T invokeAny( Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException: execute the given tasks, synchronously return the result of one of finished tasks, cancelling any unfinished tasks.

- With `invokeAll()`, even though Future.isDone() returns true for each
element in the returned List , a task could have completed normally or thrown an exception.

- With `invokeAny()`, while the first task to finish is often returned, this behavior is not guaranteed, as any completed task can be returned by this method.

- We can set timeout for `invokeAll()` and `invokeAny()`.

== Wating for results

[source, java]
----
Future<?> future = service.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello Zoo"));
----

image::future-methods.png[]

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class CheckResults {
    private static int counter = 0;
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        ExecutorService service = null;

        try {

        } catch (TimeoutException e) {
            service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
            Future<?> result = service.submit(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++) CheckResults.counter++;
            });

            result.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println("Reached!")
        } finally {
            if (service != null) service.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
----

== Introducing Callable

[source,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface public interface Callable<V> {
    V call() throws Exception;
}
----

=== Ambiguous lambda expression
- Since both `Callable` and `Supplier` are functional interface, with 1 method that take no arguments and return a value. It's impossible for Java to know which one you want to use if there are two methods, 1 take Callable and 1 take Supplier

[source,java]
----
public class AmbiguousLambdaSample {
    public static void useCallable(Callable<Integer> expression) {}
    public static void useSupplier(Supplier<Integer> expression) {}
    public static void use(Supplier<Integer> expression) {}
    public static void use(Callable<Integer> expression) {}
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        useCallable(() -> {throw new IOException();}); //COMPILES
        useSupplier(() -> {throw new IOException();}); // DOES NOT COMPILE
        use(() -> {throw new IOException();}); // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
}
----

- The second line of the main() method does not compile, as Supplier does not support check exception.

- The last line in main method(), the compiler does not take into account that an exception is thrown in the body of use(), it does not know which `use()` should be used.

- However, if you cast lambda expression, it will compile

[source,java]
----
use((Callable<Integer>) () -> {throw new IOException("");}); //COMPILES
----

=== Example with Callable

- `Future<?>` will always return `null` when calling `get()` if you `submit` a Runnable.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class AddData {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException{
        ExecutorService service = null;
        try {
            service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
            Future<Integer> result = service.submit(() -> 30 + 11);
            System.out.println(result.get());
        } finally {
            if (service != null) service.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
----

- `Runnable` and `Callable` are interchangable where the lambda does not throw an exception and there is no return type.

=== Checked exception in Runnable and Callable

[source,java]
----
service.submit(() -> {Thread.sleep(1000); return null;}) // COMPILES, because Java uses Callable
service.submit(() -> {Thread.sleep(1000);}); //DOES NOT COMPILE, because Java use Runnable
----

WARNING: If the @FunctionalInterface throws checked exception, the caller might not need to use it in a try/catch block or redeclare the exception in throws.

=== Waiting for all tasks to be finished

- using `awaitTermination(long time, TimeUnit unit)`, this method waits until all tasks are finished, or throw InterruptedException.

[source,java]
----
ExecutorService service = null;

try {
    service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    // add tasks to executor
} finally {
    if (service != null) service.shutdown();
}

if (service != null) {
    service.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    if (service.isTerminated())
        System.out.println("All tasks finished");
    else
        System.out.println("At least one task is still running");
}
----

== Scheduling Tasks

[source,java]
----
ScheduledExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
----

image::scheduled-executor-service-methods.png[]

- The first two methods return a `ScheduledFuture<V>` instance.

[source,java]
----
ScheduledExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();

Runnable task1 = () -> System.out.println("Hello Zoo");
Callable<String> task2 = () -> "Monkey";

Future<?> result1 = service.schedule(task1, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
Future<?> result2 = service.schedule(task2, 8, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
----

- If the `ScheduledExecutorService` is shutdown by the time the scheduled task execution time is reached, they will be discarded.

- `scheduleAtFixedRate()` is the closest built-in Java equivalent to Cron job in Linux.

== Increasing concurrency with pools.

image::executors-methods.png[]

- Get the number of CPUs available:
[source,java]
----
Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
----

== Synchronizing Data Access

=== Processing Data with Atomic Classes

image::atomic-classes.png[]

image::common-atomic-methods.png[]

== Improving access with Synchronized block

- A monitor is a structure that supports mutual exclusion or the property that at most one thread is executing a particular segment of code at a given time.

- In Java, any Object can be used as a monitor, along with synchronzied keyword.

[source,java]
----
SheepManager manager = new SheepManager();

synchronized(manager) {
    // 
}
----

- This code below prints 1 to 10.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class SheepManager {
    private int sheepCount = 0;
    private void incrementAndReport() {
        synchronized(this) {
            System.out.print((++sheepCount)+" ");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService service = null;

        try {
            service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20);
            SheepManager manager = new SheepManager();
            for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
            service.submit(() -> manager.incrementAndReport());
        } finally {
            if(service != null) service.shutdown();
        }
    }
}
----

- Synchronization is about  protecting data integerity  at the cost of performance.

== Concurrent Collections

[source,java]
----
private Map<String, Object> test = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

public void put(String key, String value) {
    test.put(key, value);
}

public Object get(String key) {
    return test.get(key);
}
----

=== Understanding memory consistency errors

- The purpose of concurrent collection classes is to solve common memory consistency errors. A memory consistency error occurs when two threads have inconsistent views of what should be the same data.

- When two threads try to modify the same non-concurrent collection, the JVM may throw a ConcurrentModificationException at run time.
[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> foodData = new HashMap<String, Object>();
foodData.put("penguin", 1);
foodData.put("flamingo", 2);
for(String key: foodData.keySet())
    foodData.remove(key); // ConcurrentModificationException
----
=> it is due to keySet is not properly updated after the first element is removed

However, when we change to `ConcurrentHashMap`

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> foodData = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, Object>();
foodData.put("penguin", 1);
foodData.put("flamingo", 2);
for(String key: foodData.keySet())
    foodData.remove(key);
----
=> the iterator created by keySet is updated as soon as an object is removed from the Map.

=== Working with Concurrent Classes

image::concurrent-collection-classes.png[]

[source,java]
----
Map<String,Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("zebra", 52);
map.put("elephent", 10);
System.out.println(map.get("elephent"));

Queue<Integer> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
queue.offer(31);
System.out.println(queue.peek());
System.out.println(queue.poll());

Deque<Integer> deque = new ConcurrentLinkedDeque<>();
deque.offer(1);
deque.push(4);
System.out.println(deque.peek());
System.out.println(deque.pop());
----

=== Blocking Queues

- The `BlockingQueue` is just like a regular `Queue`, except that it includes methods that will wait a specific amount of time to complete an operation.

- `offer(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`: return `false` if time elapses before space is available.
- `poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`: return `null` if the time elapses before the item is available.

[source,java]
----
try {
    BlockingQueue<Integer> blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
    blockingQueue.offer(39);
    blockingQueue.offer(3, 4, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    System.out.println(blockingQueue.poll());
    System.out.println(blockingQueue.poll(10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // Handle interruption
}
----

- The `LinkedBlockingDeque` methods

* `offerFirst(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`
* `offerLast(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`
* `pollFirst(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`
* `pollLast(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`

[source,java]
----
try {
    BlockingDeque<Integer> blockingDeque = new LinkedBlockingDeque<>();
    blockingDeque.offer(91);
    blockingDeque.offerFirst(5, 2, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
    blockingDeque.offerLast(47, 100, TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS);
    blockingDeque.offer(3, 4, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    System.out.println(blockingDeque.poll());
    System.out.println(blockingDeque.poll(950, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
    System.out.println(blockingDeque.pollFirst(200, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS));
    System.out.println(blockingDeque.pollLast(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS));
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // Handle interruption
}
----

=== SkipList Collections

- `ConcurrentSkipListSet` and `ConcurrentSkipListMap` are concurrent versions of their sorted counterparts, `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` respectively.

=== CopyOnWrite Collections

- `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `CopyOnWriteArraySet`, these classes copy all of their elements to a new underlying structure anytime an element is added, modified, or removed. By a modifi ed element, we mean that the
reference in the collection is changed. Modifying the actual contents of the collection will not cause a new structure to be allocated.

[source,java]
----
List<Integer> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(4,3,52));
for(Integer item: list) {
    System.out.print(item+" ");
    list.add(9);
}
System.out.println();
System.out.println("Size: "+list.size());
----

Output
----
4 3 52
Size: 6
----

=== Optaining Synchronized Collections

image::synchronized-collections-method.png[]

WARNING: while the methods synchronize access to data elements, such as `get()` and `set()` methods, they do not synchronize access on any iterators that you may create from the synchronized collections. You must you a synchronized block if you need to iterate over any returned collections

[source,java]
----
List<Integer> list = Collections.synchronizedList(Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
synchronized(list) {
    for (int data : list)
        System.out.print(data + " ");
}
----

WARNING: unlike concurrent collections, the synchronized collections throw an exception if they are modified within an iterator by a single thread.

[source,java]
----
Map<String, Object> foodData = new HashMap<>();
foodData.put("penguin", 1);
foodData.put("flamingo", 2);
Map<String, Object> synchronizedFoodData = Collections.synchronizedMap(foodData);
for (String key : synchronizedFoodData.keySet())
    synchronizedFoodData.remove(key);// THROW ConcurrentModificationException
----

== Parallel Streams

- By default, the number of threads available in a parallel stream is related to the number of available CPUs in your environment.

=== Creating Parallel Streams

- `parallel()`: create a parallel stream from an existing stream
[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> stream = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).stream();
Stream<Integer> parallelStream = stream.parallel();
----

- `parallelStrem()`: create a Stream from a Java Collection class
[source,java]
----
Stream<Integer> parallelStream2 = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).parallelStream();
----

NOTE: The Stream interface includes a method `isParallel()` that can be used
to test if the instance of a stream supports parallel processing. Some
operations on streams preserve the parallel attribute, while others do
not. For example, the `Stream.concat(Stream s1, Stream s2)` is parallel
if either s1 or s2 is parallel. On the other hand, `flatMap()` creates a new
stream that is not parallel by default, regardless of whether the underlying
elements were parallel.

=== Processing tasks in parallel

[source,java]
----
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6)
    .parallelStream()
    .forEach(s -> System.out.print(s+" "));
----

- The output of the above code is unpredictable, however you can use `forEachOrdered()` to force a parallel stream to process the results in order at the cost of performance.

[source,java]
----
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6)
    .parallelStream()
    .forEachOrdered(s -> System.out.print(s+" "));
----

=== Understanding performance improvements

[source,java]
----
import java.util.*;
public class WhaleDataCalculator {
    public int processRecord(int input) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(10);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handle interrupted exception
        }
        return input+1;
    }

    public void processAllData(List<Integer> data) {
        data.stream().map(a -> processRecord(a)).count();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WhaleDataCalculator calculator = new WhaleDataCalculator();
        // Define the data
        List<Integer> data = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for(int i=0; i<4000; i++) data.add(i);
        // Process the data
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        calculator.processAllData(data);
        double time = (System.currentTimeMillis()—start)/1000.0;
        // Report results
        System.out.println("\nTasks completed in: "+time+" seconds");
        // Tasks completed in: 40.044 seconds
    }
}
----

If we change it to parallelStream, the tasks completed in about 10 seconds

[source,java]
----
   public void processAllData(List<Integer> data) {
        data.parallelStream().map(a -> processRecord(a)).count();
    }
----

=== Avoiding Stateful Operations

[source,java]
----
List<Integer> data = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).parallelStream()
    .map(i -> {data.add(i); return i;}) // AVOID STATEFUL LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS!
    .forEachOrdered(i -> System.out.print(i+" "));

System.out.println();
for(Integer e: data) {
    System.out.print(e+" ");
}
----
The following is a sample generation of this code snippet using a parallel stream:
----
1 2 3 4 5 6
2 4 3 5 6 1
----
- Anytime you are working with a Collection with a parallel stream, it is recommended that you use a concurrent collection. For example, for an `ArrayList` object, the JVM internally manages a primitive array of the same type. As the size of the dynamic `ArrayList` grows, a new, larger primitive array is periodically required. If two threads both trigger the array to be resized at the same time, a result can be lost, producing the unexpected value.

=== Performing order-based tasks

Since order is not guaranteed with parallel streams, methods such as findAny() on parallel streams may result in unexpected behavior

[source,java]
----
System.out.print(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).stream().findAny().get()); // 1

System.out.print(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).parallelStream().findAny().get()); // unpredictable
----

the results of ordered operations on a parallel stream will be consistent
with a serial stream, calling `skip(5).limit(2).findFirst()` will return the
same result on ordered serial and parallel streams.



=== Unordered stream

- Create an unorder stream

[source,java]
----
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).stream().unordered();
----

This method does not actually reorder the elements; it just tells the JVM that if an
order-based stream operation is applied, the order can be ignored. For example, calling `skip(5)` on an unordered stream will skip any 5 elements, not the first 5 required on an ordered stream.

For serial streams, using an unordered version has no effect, but on parallel streams, the results can greatly improve performance:
[source,java]
----
Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6).stream().unordered().parallel();
----

=== Combining result with `reduce()`

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(Arrays.asList('w', 'o', 'l', 'f')
    .stream()
    .reduce("",(c,s1) -> c + s1,
        (s2,s3) -> s2 + s3));
----

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6)
    .parallelStream()
    .reduce(0,(a,b) -> (a-b))); // NOT AN ASSOCIATIVE ACCUMULATOR
    // resutl is unpredictable
----

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(Arrays.asList("w","o","l","f")
    .parallelStream()
    .reduce("X",String::concat));
In fact, it can output XwXoXlXf . As part of the parallel process, the identity is applied to
multiple elements in the stream, resulting in very unexpected data.
----

=== Combining result with `collect()`

Like `reduce()`, the Streams API includes a three-argument version of `collect()` that takes accumulator and combiner operators, along with a supplier operator instead of an identity.

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f").parallel();
SortedSet<String> set = stream.collect(ConcurrentSkipListSet::new, Set::add, Set::addAll);
System.out.println(set); // [f, l, o, w]
----

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("w", "o", "l", "f").parallel();
Set<String> set = stream.collect(Collectors.toSet());
System.out.println(set); // [f, w, l, o]
----

Requirements for Parallel Reduction with collect()

- The stream is parallel.
- The parameter of the collect operation has the Collector.Characteristics.CONCURRENT
characteristic.
- Either the stream is unordered, or the collector has the characteristic
Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED .

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears").parallel();
ConcurrentMap<Integer, String> map = ohMy
    .collect(Collectors.toConcurrentMap(String::length, k -> k,
    (s1, s2) -> s1 + "," + s2));
System.out.println(map); // {5=lions,bears, 6=tigers}
System.out.println(map.getClass()); // java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap

----

The Collectors class includes two sets of methods for retrieving collectors
that are both UNORDERED and CONCURRENT , `Collectors.toConcurrentMap()` and
`Collectors.groupingByConcurrent()`, and therefore it is capable of performing parallel
reductions efficiently

[source,java]
----
Stream<String> ohMy = Stream.of("lions", "tigers", "bears").parallel();
ConcurrentMap<Integer, List<String>> map = ohMy.collect(
Collectors.groupingByConcurrent(String::length));
System.out.println(map); // {5=[lions, bears], 6=[tigers]}
----

== Managing Concurrent Processes

=== CyclicBarrier

The CyclicBarrier class allows us to perform complex, multi-threaded tasks, while all
threads stop and wait at logical barriers.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.*;
public class LionPenManager {
    private void removeAnimals() { System.out.println("Removing animals"); }
    private void cleanPen() { System.out.println("Cleaning the pen"); }
    private void addAnimals() { System.out.println("Adding animals"); }
    public void performTask(CyclicBarrier c1, CyclicBarrier c2) {
        try {
            removeAnimals();
            c1.await();
            cleanPen();
            c2.await();
            addAnimals();
        } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
            // Handle checked exceptions here
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService service = null;
        try {
            service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
            LionPenManager manager = new LionPenManager();
            CyclicBarrier c1 = new CyclicBarrier(4);

NOTE: After a CyclicBarrier is broken, all threads are released and the number of threads wait-
ing on the CyclicBarrier goes back to zero. At this point, the CyclicBarrier may be
used again for a new set of waiting threads. For example, if our CyclicBarrier limit is 5
and we have 15 threads that call await() , then the CyclicBarrier will be activated a total
of three times.

=== ForkJoinPool

- The Fork/Join framework relies on the concept of recursion to solve complex tasks.

Applying the fork/join framework requires us to perform three steps:

1. Create a `ForkJoinTask` .
2. Create the `ForkJoinPool` .
3. Start the `ForkJoinTask` .

you should know how to implement the fork/join solution by extending one of two classes, `RecursiveAction` and `RecursiveTask` , both of which imple-
ment the `ForkJoinTask` interface.

The first class, `RecursiveAction`, is an abstract class that requires us to implement the `compute()` method, which returns `void` , to perform the bulk of the work. The second class, `RecursiveTask` , is an abstract generic class that requires us to implement the `compute()` method, which returns the generic type, to perform the bulk of the work.

=== RecursiveAction
[source,java]
----
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class WeighAnimalAction extends RecursiveAction {
    private int start;
    private int end;
    private Double[] weights;

    public WeighAnimalAction(Double[] weights, int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
        this.weights = weights;
    }

    protected void compute() {
        if (end-start <= 3) {
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                weights[i] = (Double) new Random().nextInt();
            }
        } else {
            int middle = start + (end-start) / 2;
            invokeAll(new WeighAnimalAction(weights, start, middle),
                new WeighAnimalAction(weights, middle, end));
        }
    }
}
----

// use it in main method
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
Double[] weights = new Double[10];
ForkJoinTask<?> task = new WeighAnimalAction(weights,0,weights.length);
ForkJoinPool pool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
pool.invoke(task);
// Print results
System.out.println();
System.out.print("Weights: ");
Arrays.asList(weights).stream().forEach(
    d -> System.out.print(d.intValue()+" "));
}
----

WARNING: Creating a ForkJoinTask and submitting it to a ForkJoinPool does not
guarantee it will be executed immediately. For example, a recursive step
may generate 10 tasks when there are only four threads available. Like a
pooled thread executor, the tasks will wait for an available thread to start
processing the data.

=== RecursiveTask<T>
[source,java]
----
public class WeighAnimalTask extends RecursiveTask<Double> {
    private int start;
    private int end;
    private Double[] weights;

    protected Double compute() {
        if (end - start <= 3) {
            double sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                weights[i] = (Double) new Random().nextInt();
                sum += weights[i];
            }

            return sum;
        } else {
            int middle = start + (end-start) / 2;
            RecursiveTask<Double> otherTask = new WeighAnimalTask(weights, start, middle);
            otherTask.fork(); //start this task in other thread

            return new WeighAnimalTask(weights,middle,end).compute() + otherTask.join();
        } 
    }
}
----

using in main

[source,java]
----
ForkJoinTask<Double> task = new WeighAnimalTask(weights,0,weights.length);
ForkJoinPool pool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
Double sum = pool.invoke(task);
System.out.println("Sum: "+sum);
----

- The `invokeAll()` method takes two instances of fork/join class and do not return a result.

- `fork()` method causes a new task to be submitted to the pool

- `join()` method called after `fork()` and causes current thread to wait for the results of the subtask.

== Deadlock

- Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other.

== Starvation

- Starvation occurs when a single thread is perpetually deined access to a shared resources or lock.

== Livelock

- Livelock occurs when two or more threads are conceptually blocked forever, although they
are each still active and trying to complete their task. Livelock is a special case of resource
starvation in which two or more threads actively try to acquire a set of locks, are unable to
do so, and restart part of the process.

- Livelock is often a result of two threads trying to resolve a deadlock.

- In practice, livelock is often very difficult issue to detect. Threads in a livelock state appear
active and able to respond to requests, even when they are in fact stuck in an endless cycle.


=== Questions note:

- Only `Callable` capbable of throwing checked exception (not `Runnable`)

- `scheduleWithFixedDelay()` and `scheduleAtFixedRate()` only support `Runnable`

- `sorted()` on a parallel stream does not mean that `findAny()` will return the first record.
`findAny()` will return the value from the first thread that retrieves a record.

- With `RecursiveAction`, `Object result = pool.invoke(action);`` can still compile if the ForkJoinTask is generic `ForkJoinTask<?>`

- The stream that is created by `flatMap()` is not parallel by default, even though its elements are parallel stream.

- Applications with many resource-heavy tasks tend to benefit more from concurrency than ones with CPU-intensive tasks.

- `Future<?>.get` wait for the computed result, if you wrap a try/catch around it, then all exceptions in `call()` are handled.
