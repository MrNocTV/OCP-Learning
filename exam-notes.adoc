## Advanced class design

- Anonymous inner classes cannot be static.

- A static nested class can contain a non - static inner class.

- `equals()` method is reflexive (x.equals(x)), symmetric (x.equals(y) & y.equals(x)), transitive (x = y, y = z -> x = z), x.equals(null) => false (for any non-null x);

- anonymous inner class cannot define a constructors explicitly since they dont have name!

- member variables of the outer instance are always accessible to inner instances, regardless of their accessibility (watch out for static method, inner class in static method cannot access instance member of the outer class)

- an object of the outerclass can access the inner's class private property

- An enum is allowed to implement interfaces.

- An enum cannot extend any other enum or class because an enum is implicitly extends from java.lang.Enum.

- java.lang.Enum (from which every enum extends implicitly), makes the clone method final. So you cannot override it.

- When interfaces are involved, more than one method declarations may be implemented by a single method declaration. In this case, the overriding declaration must have a throws clause that is compatible with all the overriden declarations. 

```java
interface House{   
    public default String getAddress(){      return "101 Main Str";   } 
}  
interface Office {   
    public static String getAddress(){      return "101 Smart Str";   
}  
interface WFH extends House, Office{ }  
class HomeOffice implements House, Office{   
    public String getAddress(){      return "R No 1, Home";   } 
}  
public class TestClass {    public static void main(String[] args) {     
    Office off = new HomeOffice();  //1     
    System.out.println(off.getAddress()); //2   
    } 
} 
```
- the `getAddress()` is inside Office interface as a static method, compiler sees that off is `Office`, and it requires the static method of an interface has to be called using the interface name, instead of the reference name.

- When a programmer does not define ANY constructor, the compiler inserts one automatically, the access modifier of which is same as that of the class.

## Concurrency

- `ConcurrentHashMap` does not support `null` key or value

- AtomicInteger: incrementAndGet(), addAndGet(), `compareAndSet(old, new)`

- Object's `wait()` method can throw IterruptedException, IllegalMonitorStateException

- A `ForkJoinPool` differs from other kinds of `ExecutorService` mainly by virtue of employing `work-stealing`

- A thread dies when the `run()` method ends.

- Calling the method `sleep()` does not kill a thread.

- it is not allowed to apply synchronized keyword to methods of an interface.

- synchronized cannot be applied to an abstract method of a class.

- synchronized can be applied to static method of a class.

- Unlike a regular java class, you cannot access a non-final static field from an enum's constructor. ( JLS 8.9.2 )

- Remember that static method of an interface can only be accessed by using the name of that interface

- An interface can redeclare a default method and also make it abstract.

- An interface can redeclare a default method and provide a different implementation.

- An interface can redeclare a static method and make it default.

- You can throw subclass of checked exception in the overriden methods.

- Remember that `Future.get()` will block until there is a value to return or there is an exception.


```java

public class TestClass {

    class ClassA {

    }

    static class classB {

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new TestClass().new ClassB(); // compilation error
        new TestClass.B(); // this is valid
    }

}

```

## Generic and collection

- Two base interfaces of the collection framework are `Map` and `Collection`.

- Binary search if cant find return (-(insertion point) - 1)

- `remove()` is a Queue method that removes from the front

- The Java exception mechanism is integrated with the Java synchronization model, so that locks are released if synchronized statements and invocations of synchronized methods complete abruptly

- The Collector created by `Collectors.toMap` throws java.lang.IllegalStateException if an attempt is made to store a key that already exists in the Map.

- If a HashMap already contains an entry for the specified key, the element already in this dictionary for that key is returned after modifying the entry to contain the new element. (when calling .put())

- `Stream.count()` returns long

## JDBC

- META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver

- To get a connection
    * put a jar into class path
    * retrieve a connection using `DriverManager.getConnection`

- Change to the database will be committed right after the update statement has completed execution

- `ResultSetMetadata` gives you the information about the result of executing a query.

- There is no difference between a stored procedure and function in terms of how it is called from JDBC code. A `CallableStatement` is used for both. `PreparedStatement` is not used for either of these. It is used to call a regular SQL query repeatedly with different parameter values

- A `CallableStatement` is easier to build and call from JDBC code than a `PreparedStatement`. 

- As per Section 6.2 of JDBC 4.1 Specification:

    * A JDBC API implementation must support Entry Level SQL92 plus the SQL command Drop Table.

    * Entry Level SQL92 represents a "floor" for the level of SQL that a JDBC API implementation must support. Access to features based on SQL99 or SQL:2003 should be provided in a way that is compatible with the relevant part of the SQL99 or SQL:2003 specification

- `PreparedStatement` offers better performance when the same query is to be run multiple times with different parameter values.

- `PreparedStatement` allows several additional SQL types such as BLOB and CLOB.

- `DriverManager.registerDriver` is a valid method but it takes java.sql.Driver instance and not a String.
This method is used by the Driver class to register itself with the DriverManager. It needs not be called by the application programmer. 

- In JDBC 4.0, if you have the jar file that implements the Driver in the classpath, the Driver is automatically registered.

- When a JDBC Connection is created, it is in auto-commit mode.

- The actual classes for Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces are provided by the JDBC driver and are therefore driver dependent.

- Thread is not an abstract class.

- ForkJoinPool implements Executor.

## Date/Time

- Instant `truncatedTo()` only support ChronoUnit.HOURS or below, other than that, it will throw an exception.

- All classess in java.time package such as classes for date, time, date and time combined, time zones, instants, duration, and clocks are immutable and thread-safe.

## Exception & assertion

java -ea:<class> myPackage.MyProgram 

java -da:<package>... myPackage.MyProgram

- `AccessDeniedException` is subclass of `IOException`

- If an exception is thrown within the `try-with-resources` block, then that is the exception the caller gets, but if the `close()` throw another exception then this exception is added to the original exception as a suppressed exception.

- Catch and finally blocks are executed after the resource opened in try-with-resources is closed

- `ClassNotFoundException` and `NoSuchFieldException` are checked exception.

-  Error or any RuntimeException can be thrown without having to declare them in the `throws` clause.

- You can enable or disable assertions in the unnamed root (default)package (the one in the current directory) using the following commands: 
java -ea:... myPackage.myProgram

- To enable assertions for the system level classes (classes in JDK) use
-esa
-enablesystemassertions

- assert syntanx: `assert <boolean_expression> : <any_expresion_but_void>`

- if assertion is disabled, `assert` will not be executed.

## Localization

- A resource bundle file could be a properties file or a class file.

- A `PropertyResourceBundle` is backed by a properties file. A properties file is a plain-text file that contains translatable text. Properties files are not part of the Java source code, and they can contain values for String objects only. If you need to store other types of objects, use a ListResourceBundle instead.  

- The `ListResourceBundle` class manages resources with a convenient list. Each ListResourceBundle is backed by a class file. You can store any locale-specific object in a ListResourceBundle. To add support for an additional Locale, you create another source file and compile it into a class file.

## NIO
- Path `normalize()` will not remove the root if the redundant `..` is already touch the root.

- You can always create a File object whether or not an actual file or directory by that name exists.

- Files.copy method will copy the file test1.txt into test2.txt. If test2.txt doesn't exist, it will be created. However, `Files.isSameFile` method doesn't check the contents of the file. It is meant to check if the two path objects resolve to the same file or not. In this case, they are not, and so, it will return false. 

- FileSystemNotFoundException - The file system, identified by the URI, does not exist and cannot be created automatically, or the provider identified by the URI's scheme component is not installed (when create URI)

- Note that none of the PrintWriter's methods throw any I/O exceptions because they suppress the errors in writing and set an internal flag for error status instead.

- The `prinwriter.checkError()` method returns true if there has been a problem in writing.

- `Console` class is `java.io` package. (`System.console()`)

- Call to `System.console()` doesn't throw any exception either. It just returns null if Console is not available.

- `PrinWriter` does not have `write(boolean)`, it does have `write(char)`, `write(int)`, `write(String)` methods.

```java
Path p1 = Paths.get("c:\\..\\temp\\test.txt");
System.out.println(p1.normalize().toUri()); // will print file:///c:/temp/test.txt
```

## Fundamental serialization

## Stream API 

- However, findAny is deliberately designed to be non-deterministic. Its API specifically says that it may return any element from the stream. If you want to select the first element, you should use findFirst.
