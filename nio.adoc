== Preface

- Unlike the old stream in `java.io`, which is blocking and you cannot go back and forth while reading the data (stream only has 1 flow), new NIO.2 introducing the new *channel concept*, it is non-blocking, and you can read data back and forth.

== Introducing `Path`

- The java.nio.file.Path interface, or Path interface for short, is the primary entry point for working with the NIO.2 API.

- Unlike `File`, `Path` supports symbolic link.

- A symbolic link is *a special file* within an operating system that serves as a reference or pointer to another file or directory.

- The NIO.2 API includes full support
for creating, detecting, and navigating symbolic links within the file system.

=== Creating Instances with Factory and Helper Classes

image::nio_interface_class_relationship.png[]

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get("pandas/cuddly.png");
Path path2 = Paths.get("c:\\zooinfo\\November\\employees.txt");
Path path3 = Paths.get("/home/zoodirector");
----

- `System.getProperty("path.separator")`
can be used to get the operating system-dependent file separator from the JVM

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get("pandas","cuddly.png");
Path path2 = Paths.get("c:","zooinfo","November","employees.txt");
Path path3 = Paths.get("/","home","zoodirector");
----

- Another way to construct a Path using the Paths class is with a URI value. A *uniform
resource identifier* (URI) is a string of characters that identify a resource It begins with
a schema that indicates the resource type, followed by a path value. Examples of schema
values include file:// , http:// , https:// , and ftp:// .

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get(new URI("file://pandas/cuddly.png")); // THROWS EXCEPTION
// AT RUNTIME
Path path2 = Paths.get(new URI("file:///c:/zoo-info/November/employees.txt"));
Path path3 = Paths.get(new URI("file:///home/zoodirectory"));
----

- URI must reference an absolute path at run time, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

- Note that the constructor new URI(String) does throw a checked `URISyntaxException`.

- Convert a `Path` back to `URI`
[source,java]
----
Path path4 = Paths.get(new URI("http://www.wiley.com"));
URI uri4 = path4.toUri();
----

=== Accessing the Underlying FileSystem Object

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("pandas/cuddly.png");
Path path2 = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("c:","zooinfo","November",
"employees.txt");
Path path3 = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("/home/zoodirector");
----

- the FileSystems factory class does give us the ability to connect to a remote file system 

[source,java]
----
FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.getFileSystem(new URI("http://www.selikoff.net"));
Path path = fileSystem.getPath("duck.txt");
----

*The power of the NIO.2 API here is that it lets us rely on the default file system
for files and directories as before, while giving us the ability to build more-complex
applications that reference external file systems.*

=== Working with Legacy File Instances

When Path was added in Java 7, the legacy `java.io.File` class was updated with a new
method, toPath() , that operates on an instance File variable:

[source,java]
----
File file = new File("pandas/cuddly.png");
Path path = file.toPath();
----
For backward compatibility, the Path interface also contains a method toFile () to
return a File instance:

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("cuddly.png");
File file = path.toFile();
----

== Interacting with Paths and Files

- most operations
available in the Path and Paths classes can be accomplished regardless of whether the
underlying file that the Path object references actually exists. For example, retrieving
the parent or root directory of a Path object does not require the file to exist, although
the JVM may access the underlying file system to know how to process the path
information.

=== Providing Optional Arguments

image::common_optional_arguments.png[]

- If the file
system does not support this feature, an AtomicMoveNotSupportedException will be thrown.

=== Using Path Objects

- Many of the methods in the Path interface transform the path value in some way and
return a new Path object, allowing the methods to be chained.

[source,java]
----
Paths.get("/zoo/../home").getParent().normalize().toAbsolutePath();
----

=== Viewing the Path with toString(), getNameCount(), ­and getName()

- toString() , returns a String representation of
the entire path. In fact, it is the only method in the Path interface to return a String .

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/land/hippo/harry.happy");
System.out.println("The Path Name is: "+path);
for(int i=0; i<path.getNameCount(); i++) {
    System.out.println("Element "+i+" is: "+path.getName(i));
}
----

----
The Path Name is: /land/hippo/harry.happy
Element 0 is: land
Element 1 is: hippo
Element 2 is: harry.happy
----

- Notice that the root element / is not included in the list of names. If the Path object
represents the root element itself, then the number of names in the Path object returned by
getNameCount() will be 0 .
What if we ran the preceding code using the relative path land/hippo/harry.happy ?

----
The Path Name is: land/hippo/harry.happy
Element 0 is: land
Element 1 is: hippo
Element 2 is: harry.happy
----

Notice that the individual names are the same. For the exam, you should be aware that
the getName(int) method is zero-indexed, with the file system root excluded from the path
components.

=== Accessing Path Components with getFileName(), getParent(), and getRoot()

- getParent() , returns a Path instance representing the parent path or
null if there is no such parent. If the instance of the Path object is relative, this method will
stop at the top-level element defined in the Path object. In other words, it will not traverse
outside the working directory to the file system root.

- getRoot() , returns the root element for the Path object or null if the
Path object is relative

[source,java]
----
import java.nio.file.*;
public class PathFilePathTest {
    public static void printPathInformation(Path path) {
        System.out.println("Filename is: " + path.getFileName());
        System.out.println("Root is: " + path.getRoot());
        Path currentParent = path;
        while((currentParent = currentParent.getParent()) != null) {
            System.out.println("
            Current parent is: "+currentParent);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printPathInformation(Paths.get("/zoo/armadillo/shells.txt"));
        System.out.println();
        printPathInformation(Paths.get("armadillo/shells.txt"));
    }
}
----

----
Filename is: shells.txt
Root is: /
Current parent is: /zoo/armadillo
Current parent is: /zoo
Current parent is: /

Filename is: shells.txt
Root is: null
Current parent is: armadillo
----

=== Checking Path Type with isAbsolute() and toAbsolutePath()

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get("C:\\birds\\egret.txt");
System.out.println("Path1 is Absolute? "+path1.isAbsolute());
System.out.println("Absolute Path1: "+path1.toAbsolutePath());
Path path2 = Paths.get("birds/condor.txt");
System.out.println("Path2 is Absolute? "+path2.isAbsolute());
System.out.println("Absolute Path2 "+path2.toAbsolutePath());
----

----
Path1 is Absolute? true
Absolute Path1: C:\birds\egret.txt
Path2 is Absolute? false
Absolute Path2 /home/birds/condor.txt
----

- Keep in mind that if the Path object already represents an absolute path, then the output
is a new Path object with the same value.

=== Creating a New Path with subpath()

- The method subpath(int,int) returns a relative subpath of the Path object, referenced
by an inclusive start index and an exclusive end index

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/mammal/carnivore/raccoon.image");
System.out.println("Path is: "+path);
System.out.println("Subpath from 0 to 3 is: "+path.subpath(0,3));
System.out.println("Subpath from 1 to 3 is: "+path.subpath(1,3));
System.out.println("Subpath from 1 to 2 is: "+path.subpath(1,2));
----

- You might notice that the subpath() and getName(int) methods are similar in that
they both return a Path object that represents a component of an existing Path . The
difference is that the subpath() method may include multiple path components, whereas
the getName(int) method only includes one.

----
Path is: /mammal/carnivore/raccoon.image
Subpath from 0 to 3 is: mammal/carnivore/raccoon.image
Subpath from 1 to 3 is: carnivore/raccoon.image
Subpath from 1 to 2 is: carnivore
----

The following two examples both throw java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at
runtime:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println("Subpath from 0 to 4 is: "+path.subpath(0,4)); // THROWS
// EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME
System.out.println("Subpath from 1 to 1 is: "+path.subpath(1,1)); // THROWS
// EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME
----

=== Using Path Symbols, relativize()

- The Path interface provides a method relativize(Path) for constructing the relative
path from one Path object to another.

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get("fish.txt");
Path path2 = Paths.get("birds.txt");
System.out.println(path1.relativize(path2));
System.out.println(path2.relativize(path1));
----

----
..\birds.txt
..\fish.txt
----

[source,java]
----
Path path3 = Paths.get("E:\\habitat");
Path path4 = Paths.get("E:\\sanctuary\\raven");
System.out.println(path3.relativize(path4));
System.out.println(path4.relativize(path3));
----

----
..\sanctuary\raven
..\..\habitat
----

NOTE: Note that the file system is not accessed to perform this comparison. For example, the root
path element E: may not exist in the file system, yet the code would execute without issue
since Java is referencing the path elements and not the actual file values.

NOTE: The `relativize()` method requires that both paths be absolute or both relative, and
it will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if a relative path value is mixed with an
absolute path value

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get("/primate/chimpanzee");
Path path2 = Paths.get("bananas.txt");
Path1.relativize(path3); // THROWS EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME
----

NOTE: On Windows-based systems, it also requires that if absolute paths are used, then both
paths must have the same root directory or drive letter. For example, the following would
also throw an IllegalArgumentException at runtime in a Windows-based system since
they use different roots:

[source,java]
----
Path path3 = Paths.get("c:\\primate\\chimpanzee");
Path path4 = Paths.get("d:\\storage\\bananas.txt");
path3.relativize(path4); // THROWS EXCEPTION AT RUNTIME
----

=== Joining Path Objects with resolve()

[source,java]
----
final Path path1 = Paths.get("/cats/../panther");
final Path path2 = Paths.get("food");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));
----

output
----
/cats/../panther/food
----

- If both paths are absolute, the new Path object with the path of the second one will be returned

[source,java]
----
final Path path1 = Paths.get("/turkey/food");
final Path path2 = Paths.get("/tiger/cage");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));
----

output
----
/tiger/cage
----

=== Cleaning Up a Path with normalize()

[source,java]
----
Path path3 = Paths.get("E:\\data");
Path path4 = Paths.get("E:\\user\\home");
Path relativePath = path3.relativize(path4);
System.out.println(path3.resolve(relativePath));
----

output
----
E:\data\..\user\home
----

apply `normalize()`
[source,java]
----
System.out.println(path3.resolve(relativePath).normalize());
----

----
E:\user\home
----

- Like relativize() , the normalize() method does not check that the file actually exists.

=== Checking for File Existence with toRealPath()

- It is similar to the `toAbsolutePath()` method in that it can convert a relative path
to an absolute path, except that it also verifies that the file referenced by the path actually exists, and thus it throws a checked `IOException` at runtime if the file cannot be located.

- The toRealPath() method performs additional steps, such as removing redundant path
elements. In other words, it implicitly calls normalize() on the resulting absolute path.

- Let’s say that we have a file system in which we have a symbolic link from food.source
to food.txt , as described in the following relationship:
/zebra/food.source → /horse/food.txt

- Assuming that our current working directory is /horse/schedule , then consider the
following code:

[source,java]
----
try {
    System.out.println(Paths.get("/zebra/food.source").toRealPath());
    System.out.println(Paths.get(".././food.txt").toRealPath());
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

output
----
/horse/food.txt
/horse/food.txt
----

- Get access to the current working directory
[source,java]
----
System.out.println(Paths.get(".").toRealPath());
----

=== Testing a Path with exists()

[source,java]
----
Files.exists(Paths.get("/ostrich/feathers.png"));
Files.exists(Paths.get("/ostrich"));
----

=== Testing Uniqueness with isSameFile()

The `isSameFile()` method first checks if the `Path` objects are equal in terms of `equal()` ,
and if so, it automatically returns true without checking to see if either file exists. If the
Path object `equals()` comparison returns `false` , then it locates each file to which the
path refers in the file system and determines if they are the same, throwing a checked
`IOException` if either `file` does not exist.

- Assuming all files in the examples exist, and cobra is a symbolic link to the snake file

[source,java]
----
try {
    System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/user/home/cobra"),
    Paths.get("/user/home/snake")));
    System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/user/tree/../monkey"),
    Paths.get("/user/monkey")));
    System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/leaves/./giraffe.exe"),
    Paths.get("/leaves/giraffe.exe")));
    System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(Paths.get("/flamingo/tail.data"),
    Paths.get("/cardinal/tail.data")));
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

Output
----
true
true
true
false
----

- in the second line, `..` cancel out `/tree`
- in the third line `.` makes the path unmodified.

=== Making Directories with createDirectory() and createDirectories()

- The directory-creation methods can throw the checked IOException , such as when
the directory cannot be created or already exists.

- for `createDirectory()`, if the parent directory does not exist, an exception will be thrown.

[source,java]
----
try {
    Files.createDirectory(Paths.get("/bison/field"));
    Files.createDirectories(Paths.get("/bison/field/pasture/green"));
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Duplicating File Contents with copy()

- `Files.copy(Path,Path)`

- Directory copies are shallow rather than deep, meaning that files and subdirectories
within the directory are not copied

[source,java]
----
try {
    Files.copy(Paths.get("/panda"), Paths.get("/panda-save"));
    Files.copy(Paths.get("/panda/bamboo.txt"),Paths.get("/panda-save/bamboo.txt"));
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Copying files with java,io and nio2

[source,java]
----
try (InputStream is = new FileInputStream("source-data.txt");
OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("output-data.txt")) {
    // Copy stream data to file
    Files.copy(is, Paths.get("c:\\mammals\\wolf.txt"));
    // Copy file data to stream
    Files.copy(Paths.get("c:\\fish\\clown.xsl"), out);
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

NOTE: The `Files.move()` method can be applied to non-empty directories only if
they are on the same underlying drive. While moving an empty directory
across a drive is supported, moving a non-empty directory across a drive
will throw an NIO.2 `DirectoryNotEmptyException` .

=== Removing a File with delete() and deleteIfExists()

- If the directory is non-empty , an exception will be thrown.

- If the target of the path is a symbolic link, only the link will be deleted.

[source,java]
----
try {
    Files.delete(Paths.get("/vulture/feathers.txt"));
    Files.deleteIfExists(Paths.get("/pigeon"));
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Reading and Writing File Data with newBufferedReader() and newBufferedWriter()

- `Files.newBufferedReader(Path,Charset)`

- Charset.defaultCharset() can be used to get the default Charset for the JVM.

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/animals/gopher.txt");
try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path,
    Charset.forName("US-ASCII"))) {
    // Read from the stream
    String currentLine = null;
    while((currentLine = reader.readLine()) != null)
        System.out.println(currentLine);
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/animals/gorilla.txt");
List<String> data = new ArrayList();
try (BufferedWriter writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(path,Charset.forName("UTF-16"))) {
    writer.write("Hello World");
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Reading Files with readAllLines()

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/fish/sharks.log");
try {
    final List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(path);
    for(String line: lines) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

== Understanding File Attributes

- metadata is data that describes other data.

=== Reading Common Attributes with isDirectory(), isRegularFile(), and isSymbolicLink()

- `Files.isDirectory(Path)`: true if Path is a symbolic link to a directory or a directory
- `Files.isRegularFile(Path)`: true if Path is a symbolic link to a file or a file
- `Files.isSymbolicLink(Path)`

- it is possible for `isRegularFile()` to return
true for a symbolic link, as long as the link resolves to a regular file.

- these three methods do not throw checked exception

[source,java]
----
Files.isDirectory(Paths.get("/canine/coyote/fur.jpg"));
Files.isRegularFile(Paths.get("/canine/types.txt"));
Files.isSymbolicLink(Paths.get("/canine/coyote"));
----

=== Checking File Visibility with isHidden()

- `Files.isHidden(Path)`: throw checked exception   

- Linux- or Mac-based systems, this
is often denoted by file or directory entries that begin with a period character ( . ), while
in Windows-based systems this requires the hidden attribute to be set

[source,java]
----
try {
    System.out.println(Files.isHidden(Paths.get("/walrus.txt")));
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Testing File Accessibility with isReadable() and isExecutable()

- `Files.isReadable(Path)` and `Files.isExecutable(Path)`

- Do not throw checked exception

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(Files.isReadable(Paths.get("/seal/baby.png")));
System.out.println(Files.isExecutable(Paths.get("/seal/baby.png")));
----

- Note that the file extension does not necessary determine whether a file is executable.

=== Reading File Length with size()

- `Files.size(Path)`

[source,java]
----
try {
    System.out.println(Files.size(Paths.get("/zoo/c/animals.txt")));
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Managing File Modifications with getLastModifiedTime() and setLastModifiedTime()

- `Files.getLastModifiedTime(Path): FileTime`

- `Files.setLastModifiedTime(Path,FileTime)`

- `FileTime.toMillis()`, `FileTime.fromMillis()`

- It means we can change last modifed time without actually chaning the file content.

[source,java]
----
try {
    final Path path = Paths.get("/rabbit/food.jpg");
    System.out.println(Files.getLastModifiedTime(path).toMillis());
    Files.setLastModifiedTime(path,
    FileTime.fromMillis(System.currentTimeMillis()));
    System.out.println(Files.getLastModifiedTime(path).toMillis());
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== getOwner() and setOwner()

- `Files.getOwner(Path): UserPrincipal`

- `Files.setOwner(Path,UserPrincipal)`

- Note that the operating system may intervene when you
try to modify the owner of a fi le and block the operation. For example, a process running
under one user may not be allowed to take ownership of a fi le owned by another user

- In order to set a file owner to an arbitrary user, the NIO.2 API provides a
`UserPrincipalLookupService` helper class for finding a `UserPrincipal` record for a
particular user within a fi le system

[source,java]
----
UserPrincipal owner = FileSystems.getDefault().getUserPrincipalLookupService().lookupPrincipalByName("jane");

UserPrincipal owner = path.getFileSystem().getUserPrincipalLookupService().lookupPrincipalByName("jane");
----

[source,java]
----
try {
    // Read owner of file
    Path path = Paths.get("/chicken/feathers.txt");
    System.out.println(Files.getOwner(path).getName());
    // Change owner of file
    UserPrincipal owner = path.getFileSystem().getUserPrincipalLookupService().lookupPrincipalByName("jane");
    Files.setOwner(path, owner);
    // Output the updated owner information
    System.out.println(Files.getOwner(path).getName());
} catch (IOException e) {
// Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Improving access with view

- A file may support multiple views, allowing you to retrieve and
update various sets of information about the file.

- `Files.readAttributes(Path, Class<A>)` returns read-only view of file attribute.

- `Files.getFileAttributeView()`, returns the underlying attribute view and provides a direct resource for modifying file information.

image::the_attribute_and_view_classes.png[]

== Reading Attributes

=== BasicFileAttributes

[source,java]
----
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes;
public class BasicFileAttributesSample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("/turtles/sea.txt");
        BasicFileAttributes data = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);
        System.out.println("Is path a directory? "+data.isDirectory());
        System.out.println("Is path a regular file? "+data.isRegularFile());
        System.out.println("Is path a symbolic link? "+data.isSymbolicLink());
        System.out.println("Path not a file, directory, nor symbolic link? "+
        data.isOther());
        System.out.println("Size (in bytes): "+data.size());
        System.out.println("Creation date/time: "+data.creationTime());
        System.out.println("Last modified date/time: "+data.lastModifiedTime());
        System.out.println("Last accessed date/time: "+data.lastAccessTime());
        System.out.println("Unique file identifier (if available): "+
        data.fileKey());
    }
}
----

=== Modifying Attributes

- BasicFileAttributeView is used to modify a file’s set of date/time values.

[source,java]
----
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.attribute.*;

public class BasicFileAttributeViewSample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path path = Paths.get("/turtles/sea.txt");
        BasicFileAttributeView view = Files.getFileAttributeView(path BasicFileAttributeView.class);
        BasicFileAttributes data = view.readAttributes();
        FileTime lastModifiedTime = FileTime.fromMillis(data.lastModifiedTime().toMillis()+10_000);
        view.setTimes(lastModifiedTime,null,null);
    }

}
----

== Presenting the New Stream methods

=== Walking the directory

- `Files.walk(path)` returns a `Stream<Path>` object that traverse the directory in a depth-first, lazy manner.

- By default, the method iterates up to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` directories deep.

[source,java]
----
try {
    Files.walk(path)
        .filter(p -> p.toString().endsWith(".java"))
        .forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {

}
----

=== Avoiding Circular Paths

- If you have a situation where you need to change the default behavior and traverse
symbolic links, NIO.2 offers the FOLLOW_LINKS option as a vararg to the walk() method.
It is recommended to specify an appropriate depth limit when this option is used. Also, be
aware that when this option is used, the walk() method will track the paths it has visited,
throwing a FileSystemLoopException if a cycle is detected.

=== Searching a Directory

- `Files.find(Path,int,BiPredicate<Path, BasicFileAttributes>)` behaves in a similar manner as the `Files.walk()` method, except that it requires the depth value to be explicitly set a long with a `BiPredicate` to filter the data.

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/bigcats");
long dateFilter = 1420070400000l;
try {
    Stream<Path> stream = Files.find(path, 10,
        (path,attributes) -> path.toString().endsWith(".java")
        && attributes.lastModifiedTime().toMillis()>dateFilter);
    stream.forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

=== Listing Directory Contents

- `Files.list()` is the same as `File.listFiles()` 

[source,java]
----
try {
   Path path = Paths.get("ducks");
    Files.list(path)
        .filter(p -> !Files.isDirectory(p))
        .map(p -> p.toAbsolutePath())
        .forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
}
----

=== Printing File Contents

- using `File.readAllLines()` to read content of a large file might result in `OutOfMemoryError`, use `Files.lines(Path)` instead.

The contents of the file are read and processed lazily,
which means that only a small portion of the file is stored in memory at any given time.
 
[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/fish/sharks.log");
try {
    Files.lines(path).forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle file I/O exception...
}
----

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/fish/sharks.log");
try {
    System.out.println(Files.lines(path)

[source,java]
----
Files.move(Paths.get("monkey.txt"), Paths.get("/animals"),
StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE,
LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS);
----

- `Files.move(Path,Path)` if the file/directory already exists, an exception will be thrown.

- `Files.move(path,path)` will move the symbolic link itself, rather than the file/directory.

- `path.toAbsolutePath()` resolves the current directory with the path

- calling `Files.resolve(Path)` with an absolute path as parameter will return the absolute path 

[source,java]
----
Path path1 = Paths.get("./goat.txt").normalize(); // k1
Path path2 = Paths.get("mule.png");
Files.copy(path1,path2,StandardCopyOption.COPY_ATTRIBUTES);
System.out.println(Files.isSameFile(path1, path2)); //k3
----

- even though the file is copied with reserved attributes, it is not the same.

- if `Files.find` has 0 as depth, it will only search the top level directory, making the code below print nothing.

[source,java]
----
Path path = Paths.get("/monkeys");
Files.find(path, 0, (p,a) -> a.isSymbolicLink()).map(p -> p.toString())
    .collect(Collectors.toList()) // y2
    .stream() // y3
    .filter(x -> x.toString().endsWith(".txt")) // y4
    .forEach(System.out::println);
----

- keep in mind: if we have access to read the file???

- `path.equals(Path)` check if they have the same string value of the path.

- `getNameCount()` of Path '.' (current directory) is 1.
